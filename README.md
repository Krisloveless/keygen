## A story about this keygen

I've been studying reverse engineering for a while, and this is the first program that I reversed by myself. 

Though debugging asm codes are pretty ~boring~ time consuming, I learnt how low architecture encrypted and by

 going through the asm code I could write out the first ever keygen.
